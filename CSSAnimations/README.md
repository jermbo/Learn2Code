# CSS Animations

CSS Animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a style describing the CSS Animation and as set of @keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate way points.

In this series we are going to learn about the what, where, when, and why of animation. We will go from the super basics and make sure we understand the terminology. To what triggers animation, what types of animation there are, when to use it, when not to animate, and so much more.

If you do not have a [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) account, I highly suggest you do so. This way you can follow along with the notes and have a safe environment to play and experiment.
