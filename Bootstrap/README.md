# Welcome To Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a front end force to be reckoned with. It has come a long way since the early days of responsive web design. It's been a tool that has led the way for standards, best practices, cross browser compatibility, and much more.

If you were a backend developer who needed to quickly prototype an idea that looked good, you went to bootstrap.

If you were a front end developer who needed a robust grid system, quick access to classes for styling, premade JavaScript for tool tips or image galleries, you went to bootstrap.

Bootstrap offed great small wins. But, it is highly customizable and can offer a very robust starting point to have your production level app or site running on.

There are so many great things that bootstrap offered the world. In this set of lectures we will dissect what makes it great. Learn about its downsides and how to avoid them. Try to answer the question, "Is bootstrap necessary for my next project"?
